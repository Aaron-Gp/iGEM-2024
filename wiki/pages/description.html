    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
       In human industrial production, agricultural activities and daily life, a large number of harmful chemicals are discharged into the environment directly or indirectly due to
inadequate understanding or improper management. Many physiological diseases of humans and wildlife are related to these chemicals. Therefore, it is necessary to fully
evaluate the biological effects and toxicity of newly developed chemicals. Oxidative damage and endocrine disruption are two important toxic effects, which have severe effects
on biological growth and development, reproduction and immune response. The existing animal or cell test evaluation methods need to be carried out in the laboratory, which
has a long cycle and complex operation. The BIT team will use the recA promoter of the SOS family and hormone-sensitive inteins to design a variety of logic gates to build a
gated microbial sensor for rapid screening and assessment of multiple toxic effects of pollutants to assist in the assessment of unknown chemicals or pollution risk monitoring of
 target water sources.

    <h2>Some advice</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>We encourage you to put up a lot of information and content on your wiki, but we also encourage you to include summaries as much as possible. If you think of the sections in your project description as the sections in a publication, you should try to be concise, accurate, and unambiguous in your achievements. Your Project Description should include more information than your project abstract.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-lg-4">
    <h2>References</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>iGEM teams are encouraged to record references you use during the course of your research. They should be posted somewhere on your wiki so that judges and other visitors can see how you thought about your project and what works inspired you.</p>
