Intein peptides are protein analogs found in self-splicing RNA introns, and their insertion can lead to the inactivation of the host protein. Typically, they excise themselves from the host cell after translation, restoring the activity of the host protein. By replacing the homing endonuclease domain in the intein peptide with a hormone receptor binding domain, we can construct a hormone-sensitive intein peptide, which can be used to create recognition elements for endocrine disruption effects.
