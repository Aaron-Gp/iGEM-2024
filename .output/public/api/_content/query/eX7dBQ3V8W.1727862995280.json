Long-term oxidative stress accelerates cellular aging and may also lead to male infertility and the development of multiple chronic diseases. Thus, there is a close link between exposure to endocrine disruptors and cellular oxidative damage, a potential promoter to multiple health problems. Therefore, it is necessary to detect the endocrine interference effects of endocrine disruptors and oxidative damage effects in the relevant location samples."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"_1-puc19-preca-bsfbfp-bl21"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"1. pUC19-PrecA-BsFbFp-BL21"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"strain-construction"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Strain construction"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We plan to design a portable microbial sensor, in which the sensor chamber will be maintained in a nearly anoxic state.
