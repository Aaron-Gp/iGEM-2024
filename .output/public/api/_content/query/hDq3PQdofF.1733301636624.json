Luo pointed out that after confirming that a substance is polluting, the government departments will commission professional technical institutions to conduct research and investigation every year, and if the result is ultra-ultra-trace, relatively safe, no further measures will be taken. But if the concentration is high, the government will take measures and test the water quality of the test site or its source to track its possible source. In the analysis of new pollutants, including endocrine disruptors, government departments will conduct toxicological tests on chemical substances based on cutting-edge international research to determine that a substance may be harmful to the human body. This is a very important part of the testing process, because the government departments will concentrate the samples, which will lead to a variety of substances will be detected, and only when these substances are associated with toxicological effects and confirmed to be harmful to the human body, it is necessary to define endocrine disruptors and monitor. In terms of control, the government has corresponding emission standards for well-known endocrine disruptors; For new pollutants such as endocrine disruptors detected, the government will continue to confirm whether they belong to the emission substances already on the control list.

For endocrine disruptors, the government does not include them in routine testing tasks, but they are regularly included in testing efforts.
