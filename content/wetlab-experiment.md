## What IS Endocrine Pollutant？

Endocrine pollutants, also known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are substances that can interfere with the normal functioning of the endocrine system. These chemicals mimic, block, or alter the effects of hormones in the body, potentially leading to adverse health effects. The endocrine system, which includes glands such as the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary, is responsible for releasing hormones that regulate many vital functions, including growth, metabolism, and reproduction.

## What IS DNA Damage？

DNA damage refers to alterations in the chemical structure of DNA, which can affect its function and integrity. This damage can occur through various mechanisms and can lead to a range of cellular consequences if not properly repaired.
